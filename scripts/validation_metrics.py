# Note, we have trained on a larger data set than we did for model selection.
# As such, this MASE cannot be compared to the MASEs listed in the diagnostic
# app. It's a measure of performance relative to the baseline on the new
# training set of all data before 2020.
# (The deep reason here is that time series are non-iid, and as such, we
# must make train/dev/validation splits along choronological lines.
# An unfortunate artefact of this is never having the metrics for the exact
# model we deploy.)
